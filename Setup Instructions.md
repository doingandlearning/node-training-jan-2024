# Node
Node LTS version 18 or above.

It can be helpful to use a Node version manager to switch between different versions of Node.

When on a Mac, I use `nvm`. Setup instructions found here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

When on a PC, I use `nvs`. Here are the setup instructions: https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md


# Visual Studio Code v 1.65 or above

You're free to use whichever code editor you prefer but I'll be using Visual Code during this course.

# Git

Ideally we will be using Git to download examples from the internet â€“ if this is not possible then a ZIP of the Git repo can be provided during to the course.

If this isn't a technology you're familiar with don't fear.


# MongoDB Community Edition

We use MongoDB to install locally or a cloud version.

Version 5+

On a Mac

On a Windows PC

If you'd rather not do this, we can use a cloud version of Mongo, called Atlas. You can sign up for a free account here: https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database
